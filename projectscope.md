# FlowState Project Scope

## Project Overview
FlowState is an AI-powered music intelligence system that creates emotionally optimized song queues. Users select songs, and FlowState generates perfect flowing sequences that create seamless emotional journeys.

## Core Features

### 1. Emotional Music Analysis
- Extract audio features: tempo, key, energy, instrumentation, genre
- Analyze emotional content: valence, arousal, dominance
- Create psychological profiles for each song
- Build song compatibility matrices

### 2. Dynamic Auto-Queue System
- **Initial Queue Generation**: User clicks song → AI generates 10-20 song queue
- **Smart Re-optimization**: User adds song → AI efficiently inserts/restructures queue
- **Flow Optimization**: Ensure smooth transitions between all songs
- **Context Awareness**: Consider time of day, user mood, listening patterns

### 3. Platform Integration
- Chrome extension for universal music platform support
- API integrations: Spotify Web API, YouTube Music, Apple Music
- Cross-platform song matching and playback

### 4. Real-time Optimization
- Queue generation: <100ms response time
- Efficient re-optimization when queue modified
- Predictive caching for common song combinations

## Technical Architecture

### Backend
- **FastAPI** for high-performance API
- **PostgreSQL** for user data and song metadata
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **Vector Database** (Pinecone/Chroma) for song similarity search

### ML Pipeline
- **Audio Analysis**: Librosa for feature extraction
- **Emotional Modeling**: Custom neural networks for emotion inference
- **Optimization Engine**: Graph algorithms for queue optimization
- **Real-time Inference**: TensorFlow Serving for model deployment

### Frontend
- **Chrome Extension**: Universal platform integration
- **React** for settings panel and visualization
- **Web Audio API** for real-time audio analysis
- **WebSocket** connection for real-time updates
